    "journey": {
      "description1": "My passion for technology started when I was young and continues to grow as the years go by. What began as a hobby became an obsession — not just writing code, but creating something that can improve lives. As a software engineer, what I find fulfilling is solving tough problems and turning ideas into reality and making them work. For me, code isn't just a line of text on a monitor; it's figuring out how to make tools that enable people to succeed.",
      "description2": "I am a do-it-and-learn and try-out kind of person. From diving into a new paradigm, experimenting with a tool, or tweaking a side project, I am always looking for ways to learn and improve. Beyond the screen, some of my interests include gaming, hiking, and going to music festivals with friends.",
      "description3": "Right now I focus on full-stack design, using modern tech to make ideas shine. Building apps that do more than just run, they’re smooth to use — and made to be fun.",
