        "The 50five e-Mobility app was developed to make electric driving more accessible and user-friendly. With the app, users can easily find charging stations across Europe and filter based on personal preferences, such as availability, connector type, and charging capacity.\n\nThe network covers more than 420,000 charging points across Europe, ensuring that drivers always have access to a suitable location. The focus is on delivering an intuitive user experience, with fast search and filter options tailored to the userâ€™s needs.\n\nThe app elevates electric driving to the next level by combining reliability, ease of use, and scalability, supporting the growth of sustainable mobility.",

The system monitors real-time events from the backend and provides instant feedback on reset attempts.\n\nAll reset activities are logged and presented in an easy-to-use table format, allowing operators to filter and sort by parameters such as date, reset type, malfunction, and status. This enables easy identification of recurring issues and monitoring of performance over time.\n\nBy bringing reset operations together into one intuitive interface, the dashboard maximizes operational efficiency, reduces downtime, and allows for faster response to charging station faults.",

        "In my third year of study, we were lucky enough to have the opportunity to work on a team project to design and build a web application. The project was not only a technical challenge, but also one to learn in an international environment, as we were challenged to travel to Bologna, Italy, and finalize and present our efforts.\n\nThe motive of the application was to unite schools across the globe and create an environment where students and teachers could share ideas on different projects. Through global collaboration, the application aimed to encourage exchange of knowledge, innovation, and cross-cultural awareness.\n\nWorking on the project, I acquired useful knowledge in web development, team work, and cross-cultural collaboration that helped me enhance both my technical and communication abilities.",
